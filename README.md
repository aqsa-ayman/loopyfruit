# Loopyfruit
a beginner game made for a Code First: Girls python class. 

Idea: You control the basket, moving side to side catching apples. As your score increases they fall faster and you avoid the rotten apples.
If you hit one you lose!

**To Do:**
- Welcome screen
- Change the background
- Introduce the "rotten apples"
- The apples fall faster if score > 20 but perhaps make it even faster if score > 50 or 100

Made with python and the pygame module.
